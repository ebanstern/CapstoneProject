### Smith, Edward (smitheda)
Main Role: Developer

#### Training
- Learn the ins and outs of Xcode and how to use it for iOS app development (5 weeks, 3-4 hours/week).  Will download Xcode for mac, and will plan on going through video tutorials online and trying to learn it from the beginning.  There are extensive tutorials available online like at these links: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVjw2L_osKg, https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2D6eRvCeMtcF5OGHf1-trw.  The 'codewithchris' youtube channel has tons of videos on developing apps for iOS.
- Learn how to use Swift for iOS app development (3 weeks, 4 hours/week).  I will also learn how to incorporate swift into Xcode while developing an application.  'codewithchris' has a lot of videos on this, and in the beginning stages I plan on getting the Swift playgrounds application on my iPad and learning some of the basics that way.
- API Integration Training (3 weeks, 4 hours/week).  Learn what it takes to incorporate other API's into our own application.  More specifically from Spotify, as this is the streaming service we plan on using for our application.  Spotify's developer page with information on their API and iOS SDK can be found here: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/ios/#tutorial-and-examples.  
- iOS app plug-ins research and integration (3 weeks, 3 hours/week).  I want to learn how to incorporate plug-ins into mobile applications, and then find some that will be useful to our application and incorporate them into our final version.  This article has an extensive list of possible resources for this, but I figure i will find more once I start to learn more about hiw this process works. https://www.businessofapps.com/marketplace/app-development-software/research/ios-development-tools/#4
